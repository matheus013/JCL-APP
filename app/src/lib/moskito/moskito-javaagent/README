================== PLEASE NOTE THE JAVA AGENT IS YET BETA ================== 

To add an agent to a Java VM to monitor basic JVM Parameters add following properties to the startup script of your application:
-javaagent:<moskito-folder>moskito-javaagent-2.8.7.jar -DmoskitoAgentPort=<port> -DapplicationPackages=<packages to monitor>

For example for your tomcat, it would be following lines in your startup.sh:
export JAVA_OPTS=" $JAVA_OPTS -DmoskitoAgentPort=9415"
export JAVA_OPTS=" $JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/opt/moskito-javaagent/moskito-javaagent-2.8.7.jar"
export JAVA_OPTS=" $JAVA_OPTS -DapplicationPackages=<your packages comma separated>"


NOTE in early versions of the agent it wouldn't honour the port setting. The default port is 9451. Port can be changed in the configuration directory, moskito-javaagent-config.json property moskitoBackendPort.

To add this monitored JVM to your MoSKito Control Instance, use following declaration:
{
     "name": "your-server-name",
     "category": "your-category",
     "connectorType": "RMI",
     "location": "<ip>:<port>"
 },

Note: If you want to run the agent on one VM (servervm) and moskito control on another:
you can use the hostname of the servervm , but ensure that your servervm resolves to the ip the host is available under. 
For example if you have following line as first line in your servervms /etc/hosts
BAD:
127.0.0.1       localhost	yourservername

This won't resolve yourservername from another machine, and the code running on your server will bind itself to 127.0.0.1 and won't be accessable from outside.
If your ip is (for example) 192.168.178.34 your /etc/hosts should look like this:
GOOD EXAMPLE:
192.168.178.34  yourservername yourservername.local yourservername.yourorganisation.tld
127.0.0.1       localhost	

Refer to MoSKito Control Configuration Guide for further details.
